# Lost Person Model
Generate the trajectories of a lost person using a set of 6 behaviors on a map that features elevation, linear features, and inaccessible areas. 

Run "main_hiker.py" with initial conditions in the format of "InitialConditions.csv" that have been converted to map coordinates in "ConvertedConditions.csv". The elevation, linear feature, and inaccessible area maps are generated using Larkin's scripts in _ags_grabber. Select the number of behaviors to run out of 462. The file "beh_dist_6.csv" contains all distributions of the six behaviors in the model. Input all parameters in line 314 to run.
