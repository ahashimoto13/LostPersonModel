# Lost Person Model
Generate the trajectories of a lost person using a set of 6 behaviors on a map that features elevation, linear features, and inaccessible areas. 

Run _main_hiker.py_ with initial conditions in the format of _InitialConditions.csv_ that have been converted to map coordinates in _ConvertedConditions.csv_. The elevation, linear feature, and inaccessible area maps are generated using Larkin's scripts in _ags_grabber_. Select the number of behaviors to run out of 462. The file _beh_dist_6.csv_ contains all distributions of the six behaviors in the model. Input all parameters in line 314 to run.
